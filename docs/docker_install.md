#### What is docker container and how do I install it?
From docker.com;
> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs 
> quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, 
> standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, 
> system tools, system libraries and settings.

A docker container can be thought of a process with all its dependencies coupled into a package and this package runs 
as a normal process on the host. 

##### Install docker:
```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
These steps are from: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script

After installation, disconnect from your host (RPi) and re-connect and check docker is installed correctly.  
After re-connecting, type `docker version` and you should get a response from like this
```bash
$ docker version

#### What is docker-compose and how do I install it?
Its just a simpler way of running and managing docker containers.

You need python 3 to install docker-compose.

Not sure if you already have python 3?
Just type on the console, `python3` and if you are put in the python console then you have python3 installed, if not
 follow steps to install python3. You may `python3` installed but not `python3-pip`. In that case just installed `python3-pip`,
 command `sudo apt install python3-pip`
 
##### Install python 3 and python 3 pip
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
```

##### Install docker-compose
```bash
$ sudo pip3 -v install docker-compose
```

After installation, check if docker-compose is installed correctly. Type `docker-compose version` and you should get a response
like this
```bash
$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build unknown
docker-py version: 5.0.3
CPython version: 3.7.3
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.1d  10 Sep 2019
```

##### Got error while docker or docker-compose installation?
- Check that docker isn't already installed on your host. 
- Try installation again after a reboot.
- Still not working? Try and start from clean slate, re-install the OS on SD card or try googling.
